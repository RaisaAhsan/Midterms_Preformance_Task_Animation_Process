          Our topic: Book bans.<br/>
          What are book bans? It's a form of censorship, it’s when organizations, governments, and individuals remove books from libraries or restrict access because they don’t approve of the content.
          Book bans are caused by the following groups:
        </p> 
        <ul>
            <li>45% Patrons</li>
            <li>18% Parents</li>
            <li>13% Board/administration</li>
            <li>12% Political and Religious groups</li>
            <li>8% Librarians/teachers</li>
            <li>3% Elected officials</li>
            <li>1% Students</li>
        </ul>
          Where they occur:
         <ul>
            <li>66% Pubic libraries</li>
            <li>19% School libraries</li>
            <li>12% Schools</li>
            <li>2% Academia</li>
            <li>1% Special/person libraries</li>
        </ul>
      
          Main causes for book bans:
            <ul>
             <li>Racism</li>
             <li>Misinformation</li>
             <li>Graphic content</li>
             <li>Stereotypical ideas</li>
             <li>Gender Dysphoria</li>
             <li>LGBTQIA+</li>
             <li>Profanity</li>
             <li>Radical religions</li>
             <li>Sexual content</li>
             <li>Violence</li>
        </ul>
          Why it’s important to not ban books:
             It censors content and contradicts the right to freedom of speech and thought. Even if a book is insensitive and not appropriate, you could use it as an example of how not to act and what not to say, there are learning possibilities everywhere. One might find a topic unnecessary to acknowledge while others face real-life issues relating to those “unnecessary topics.” Humans write what they experience and ideas they think about it, to take that away from someone is to take away their representation, it still doesn't change the fact that it actually happened. For example, if a historical excerpt from a bad person’s journal was in a book and people wanted it censored because it held negative views on certain things, it would not change the fact that the figure thought and said those things.
